Deployed at: <https://jentoobento.github.io/contact-example/>

Notes:

- Given a PSD file, this is a pixel perfect copy that is also functional
- Writing in vanilla Javascript is very painful
- Would rather have the option to use a framework (such as React) for easier functionality

Known Bugs:

- Validation for form
- UI for validation
- Message box for submission confirmation
- More than 1 Title can be clicked at a time
- Functionality for other clickable items?
